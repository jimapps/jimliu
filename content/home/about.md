# Biography

Xiaojin (Jim) Liu is a post-doctoral senior researcher at the Darden School of Business. His research is focused on developing and evaluating innovative and responsible operations around management practices related to human capital and technology. His work is always motivated by real world challenges in global supply chains that require firms to align their operations with the needs of multiple stakeholders. In particular, he aims to understand (i) how firms encompass innovative and responsible operation practices in the value creation process, and (ii) given the emerging need, how firms develop and manage their technology effectively. 

To address research questions in these two streams, he conducts analysis through the application of empirical and computational methods involving statistics, econometrics, psychometrics, and data analytics.  His broad set of skills related to large-scale data management and analysis are one of his distinct strengths.
