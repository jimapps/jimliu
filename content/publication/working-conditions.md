abstract = "This study addresses the question in supply chains from a retailer's perspective: How do working conditions in a supplier factory impact the supplier's trustworthiness? We focus on factories in the Bangladesh ready-made garment (RMG) industry that supply North American and European retailers. These retailers have adopted an innovative approach towards improving the working conditions of supplier factories by forming consortiums: Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety (Alliance), and Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh (Accord). We characterize supplier factory working conditions in terms of three types of risks, namely, structural risk, fire risk, and electrical risk. The empirical analysis is conducted using archival data on safety inspections from Alliance and Accord. The results and findings provide nuanced insights into the marketplace implications of working condition risks in supplier factories, and highlight the sensitivity of the retailer-supplier relationship to such risks."
